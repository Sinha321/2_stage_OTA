# 2_stage Operational Amplifier
#### A two-stage operational amplifier consists of a differential amplifier at the. input stage, while the second stage is a high gain stage biased by the output of the differential amplifier.An n stage op-amp involves n operational amplifiers between input and output. So a single stage involves 1 op- amp while two stage involves 2 op-amps to get final output.

* Verification of voltage gain on the basis of simulated and calculated values
* Operating point analysis to calculate DC voltages and current levels in the circuit
* Transient analysis to measure simulated value of single-ended output peak to peak (Vout p-p), differential input peak to peak (Vid p-p) and voltage gain (Av)
* Use .meas statement to calculate Vid p-p, Vout p-p and voltage gain Av of the circuit

* Gain = Vout/Vid
#### The gain is more than 5000 which verifies that the output is correct.

#### Applications:
*  Op amps are used in a wide variety of applications in electronics. Some of the more common applications are: as a voltage follower, selective inversion circuit, a current-to-voltage converter, active rectifier, integrator, a whole wide variety of filters, and a voltage comparator.
*  Two-stage operational amplifiers are the most common used multistage amplifier because it can provide high gain and high output swing.
