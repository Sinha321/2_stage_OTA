# 2_stage Operational Amplifier
#### A two-stage operational amplifier consists of a differential amplifier at the. input stage, while the second stage is a high gain stage biased by the output of the differential amplifier.An n stage op-amp involves n operational amplifiers between input and output. So a single stage involves 1 op- amp while two stage involves 2 op-amps to get final output.

* Verification of voltage gain on the basis of simulated and calculated values
* Operating point analysis to calculate DC voltages and current levels in the circuit
* Transient analysis to measure simulated value of single-ended output peak to peak (Vout p-p), differential input peak to peak (Vid p-p) and voltage gain (Av)
* Use .meas statement to calculate Vid p-p, Vout p-p and voltage gain Av of the circuit
